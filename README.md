# About the BrasiliApp
The app works by consulting Api's government and providing information often difficult to find by ordinary users.

## What data the application shows?
The app shows different information for deputies and senators, since the Api's provided by the federal government are different in organization and granularities, such as the expenses of the parliamentary quota, which are made available via api to the deputies, but are not made available to the senators.

For the deputies, the information displayed is:
Expenses: In the Expense tab, a list of the deputy's expenses in the current month is displayed, and the user can navigate through a tab and see the expenses of previous months, in that listing besides the value information, there is the date information, and the company where the member of parliament held that expenditure.

Projects: In the projects tab it is possible for the user to take notice of the projects in which the parliamentarian participated in the current year by a navigation consult projects of previous years. In the detail of each project it is possible to see in which situation is the movement of the respective project in the camera and also to see the integral of the document that originated the opening of that project.

Contact: And the last tab is where you have contact information, such as the office address, email and the office phone, in case the user wants to speak to the parliamentarian's office, just click the call button now :)
